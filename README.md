# ProjectFeatures
October CMS plugin which extends the 'Blog' plugin by RainLab. It allows you to add and manage project features (or other types of list content) for a specific blog category. 

You can add new features to list on each project, just like how you can add categories, then you can add them to the project by selecting them from the 'Project Information' tab on the post. There are also input fields for Site Name and Site URL.

The 'icon' field expects a class name from Font Awesome such as 'fa-cog', 'fa-asterisk' etc.

Configuration options allow you to define the blog category to use as a source of posts (defaults to 'web-showcase') and the numbers of posts to display (defaults to 3).

This plugin can also be used as a snippet in the 'Pages' plugin just by dragging the snippet into the code editing area.
